Done:

- Removed Obstacle
- created a button class to encapsulate magic numbers in the menu classes and to handle button clicks.
- Refactered the button clicking code in the menu classes
- Moved the private menuselect classes out of the menu classes into its own public class
- Finish refactoring the buttons in the menu classes
- add the buttons to the arraylist
- explore instanceofs
- PlatformSingle now extends CollidableGameObject instead of Obstacle
- make sure that the names are good
- Moved CollidableGameObject, Collision, ConfigurationFileParser into the Util folder
- Explore the packages for poorly names classes and rename them
- Look at how the sounds is being handled so we can convert the wavs to something more efficient
	(javax.sound.sample can use AIFF, AU and WAV)
- Changed the members in DyehardDistanceMeter to be private instead of protected
	Also trying to figure out what it does, it is only called once in 
	DyehardUI
	
ToDo:
 
- look at the CollisionManager as it is not being called by any class 
				(was made to be used with Collidable.js which was removed)
- PrimitiveSet is never called
- UpdateManager is never called
- Make button Hierarchy and make a do action
- java.sound, we need mp3's, how to play an mp3 in java, how to make an mp3 file reader
	that works with java sound
